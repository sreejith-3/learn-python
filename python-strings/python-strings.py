## -- Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
print("Hello")
print('Hello')

## -- You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'Johnny'")
print('He is called "Johnny"')
