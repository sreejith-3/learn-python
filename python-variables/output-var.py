x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

# Output multiple variables seperated by a coma.
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "steel"
print(x, y, z)

x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "mango"
print(x + y + z)

# plus character acts as a mathematical operator
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

# The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
